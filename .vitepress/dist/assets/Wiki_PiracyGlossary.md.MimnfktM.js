Each seed adds 1.0 to this number, as they have one complete copy of the file. A connected peer with a fraction of the file available adds that fraction to the availability, if no other peer has this part of the file.</td></tr><tr><td>BitTorrent</td><td>A special kind of Peer-to-Peer system. It uses a central location which coodinates the downloads but it doesn&#39;t host any downloads. The download itself consists of several pieces offered by various users.</td></tr><tr><td>Connectability</td><td>Connectability relates to the state of ‚Äúbeing connectable‚Äù. Being connectable means that an incoming port on your computer is open thereby allowing ‚Äúother peers in the Bit Torrent swarm to be able to make connections to you‚Äù (that is to say, ‚Äúpeople in the same torrent as you can contact you in order to share data.‚Äù). A connectable user can share data with anyone in the torrent whereas a unconnectable user is restricted to sharing data only with peers who are connectable, being unconnectable also negatively affects the speed of the ‚Äúswarm‚Äù.</td></tr><tr><td>Freeleech</td><td>Freeleech means that the download size of the torrent does not count towards your overall ratio, only the uploaded amount on the torrent counts toward your ratio.</td></tr><tr><td>Hash</td><td>The hash is a digital fingerprint in the form of a string of alphanumeric characters (typically hexadecimal) in the .torrent file that the client uses to verify the integrity of data that is being transferred. &quot;Hash&quot; is the shorter form of the word &quot;hashsum&quot;. Torrent files contain information such as the URL of the torrent&#39;s tracker, a list of files contained within a torrent, their size, format and relevant attributes. The torrent client will check each &quot;piece&quot; of the torrent against the hash. If it fails verification, the data is discarded and requested again.</td></tr><tr><td>Hit-and-run(HnR)</td><td>To intentionally &quot;leech&quot; a file; downloading a file while seeding as little as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>IP Address</td><td>An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as a way to identify and locate devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other and with other networks. IP addresses can be dynamic or static, meaning they can change or remain the same over time.</td></tr><tr><td>Leech / Leeching</td><td>Leech has two meanings. Often, leecher is synonymous with downloader: simply describing a peer or any client that does not have 100% of the data. The term leech also refers to a peer (or peers) that has a negative effect on the swarm by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload.</td></tr><tr><td>Magnet</td><td>A type of hyperlink that enables the downloading of files and data from P2P sharing networks, particularly torrent networks.</td></tr><tr><td>Peer</td><td>A peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the Internet to which other clients connect and transfer data. Depending on context, &quot;peer&quot; can refer either to any client in the swarm or more specifically to a downloader, a client that has only parts of the file.</td></tr><tr><td>Port Forwarding</td><td>Port forwarding, sometimes called port mapping, allows computers or services in private networks to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G1ueMDgwxw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Video Explaining Port Forwaring</a> or <a href="https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Beginners Guide to Port Forwarding.</a></td></tr><tr><td>Private Tracker</td><td>A private tracker is a BitTorrent tracker that restricts use by requiring users to register with the site. The method for controlling registration used among many private trackers is an invitation system, in which active and contributing members are given the ability to grant a new user permission to register at the site, or a new user goes through an interview process.</td></tr><tr><td>Public Tracker</td><td>Public or open trackers can be used by anyone by adding the tracker address to an existing torrent, or they can be used by any newly created torrent.</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio</td><td>Ratio or Share Ratio is a number determined by dividing the amount of data that user has uploaded by the amount of data they have downloaded. Final share ratios over 1.0 carry a positive connotation in the BitTorrent community, because they indicate that the user has sent more data to other users than they received. Likewise, share ratios under 1 have negative connotation.</td></tr><tr><td>Seed / Seeding</td><td>A seed refers to a machine possessing all of the data (100% completion). A peer or downloader becomes a seed when it completely downloads all the data and continues/starts uploading data for other peers to download from. Seeding is the uploading of already downloaded content for others to download from.</td></tr><tr><td>Seedbox</td><td>A Seedbox is a server box that is rented each month to download and seed torrent files. Seedboxes are generally used for the uploading and downloading of digital files generally making use of the BitTorrent protocol though they can also be used on other file sharing websites.</td></tr><tr><td>Super-Seeding</td><td>Super-Seeding (aka &#39;Initial Seeding&#39;) is an algorithm for the BitTorrent communications protocol that helps downloaders become uploaders more quickly, but it introduces the danger of total seeding failure if there is only one downloader.</td></tr><tr><td>Swarm</td><td>All peers (including seeds) sharing the same content are called a swarm.</td></tr><tr><td>Torrent</td><td>A torrent file or meta-info file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.</td></tr><tr><td>Tracker</td><td>A BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol. The &quot;tracker&quot; server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines, which ones are available at time of the client request, and helps coordinate efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file.</td></tr></tbody></table>',31),n=[i];function s(d,l,c,h,m,u){return e(),a("div",null,n)}const p=t(o,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};
