They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process.

It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software.</p><p><strong>How did I get infected?</strong></p><p>It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher‚Äôs website directly.</p><p><strong>How to prevent future infections:</strong></p><p>Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using Ninite for installing/updating software is very easy &amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.</p><p>The following tools will aid you in keeping your computer clean:</p><p><strong>Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Malwarebytes ‚≠ê </a> (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BitDefender</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ESET Free Online Scanner</a></p></li></ul><hr><h3 id="how-to-avoid-malware" tabindex="-1">How to avoid malware: <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-avoid-malware" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to avoid malware:&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>If you&#39;re going to download software/games, definitely avoid the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">piratebay</a>. They have an immense amount of fake torrents and it&#39;s just not worth the risk of wading through their crap heap.</p><p>If you&#39;re going to download other torrents that aren&#39;t software, you can at least take preliminary measures that you&#39;re not running a fake file, even if you download from trustworthy torrent sites.</p><p>The following examples use video files as an example, and while it is wholly possible to include malware in anything, malware in files like video files, music files, isn&#39;t a likely scenario. Even then, they would have to target a specific program (ie. a specific video player) to attempt to exploit in order to tailor a video file with malware only meant to be able to run on such a video player. The main idea here is to use up-to-date programs in order to prevent being a victim of most of these exploits.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking for video, obviously an exe file is not what you&#39;re looking for, so that&#39;s an obvious candidate for the trash bin. Other attack vectors include intentionally bloated videos that simply contain messages like &quot;download <code>x</code> codec to properly view this video&quot;. In the download folder there may be a link or executable to install the supposed &quot;codecs&quot;, which will obviously be malware.</p><p>SFX files may also be used to spread malware, as they are &quot;self extracting executables&quot;, but by all intents and purposes treated as executables themselves. Do not run software if you do not trust the source.</p><p>Pay close attention to the file icon to make sure that it&#39;s recognized as a video file instead of anything else. If you have file extensions hidden, files such as <code>NotAVirus.mp4.exe</code> will simply show as <code>NotAVirus.mp4</code>, but they&#39;ll show the executable icon because Windows sees the real file extension. Make sure you <a href="https://support.winzip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011457948-How-to-configure-Windows-to-show-file-extensions-and-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">unhide file extensions</a>.</p><p>!!!danger Be on the lookout for RTL naming schemes that may make a filename of <code>filename.3pm.exe</code> be displayed as <code>filename.exe.mp3</code>: <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/spoof-using-right-to-left-override-rtlo-technique-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Further Reading</a>. !!! Another attack vector includes Windows shortcuts, which will provide (as an example) a supposed videofile.avi video file but it&#39;s actually shortcut to a batch / powershell other type of script, and won&#39;t show as such even with file extensions shown. The file icon may also be one similar to that of a video player&#39;s, but if you pay close attention to it, you&#39;ll notice an arrow in the corner that indicates it&#39;s a <code>shortcut</code>. Also note the <code>file type</code> column in file explorer showing Shortcut: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/e0Cgeje.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://i.imgur.com/e0Cgeje.jpg</a>. In the screenshot, the tiny filesize is a giveaway, but these attack vectors typically 0-byte pad the file to inflate the filesize, in an attempt to make it look more convincing. <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rising-trend-attackers-using-lnk-files-download-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Some reading on this</a> [TrendMicro]. This type of download will never not be malware.</p><p>Use proper video players instead of the default Windows media player, I recommend VLC.</p><p>Popular video file types will be avi, mp4, mkv. wmv, wma video / audio containers&#39; specs allow for scripts, which windows media player can try to run.</p><p>Not very common, but .scr files are &quot;screensaver setter&quot; files that are actually just executables. Avoid these.</p>',54),i=[s];function n(l,u,p,c,d,h){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const w=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,w as default};
