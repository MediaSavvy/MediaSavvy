::: warning Before you do anything, make sure you do the following:

- Make sure to have an [adblocker](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Adblocking/) before going to any websites listed here.
- Use an antivirus to be safe. Windows Defender is more than enough but if you want to be extra safe, you should do an occasional scan using [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou).
- When torrenting make sure to use a reliable VPN such as Mullvad or ProtonVPN and bind them to your torrenting client.
- It is recommended that you use [Firefox](https://firefox.com), one of the best non-chromium browsers, with the best support for uBlock Origin. 
- Make sure to change your [DNS](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/dns/).  This can increase your browsing speed and bypass censorship from your ISP.

:::

::: tip Additional information:
- All these websites are checked by me and are safe, however, some links may become dangerous, even though they were safe before, so always be cautious whilst browsing these sites.
- Any program/website marked with a ⭐ means that they are good quality, reliable and recommended by me.
- To see what websites and programs to avoid, [go here](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/UnsafeSites).
- Always scan the files you download using [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to make sure it's safe.
