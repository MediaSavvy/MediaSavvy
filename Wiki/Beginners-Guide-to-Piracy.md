# Beginners guide to piracy (Currently being updated!)

## What you need to know:

- Read the FAQ about piracy below.

- If you are torrenting be sure to use a VPN to avoid DMCA letters from your ISP. MediaSavvy recommends a paid VPN for torrenting such as Mullvad or ProtonVPN. If you want to use a free VPN you can use Cloudflare WARP or RiseUP VPN, although not recommended. Make sure to [bind your VPN](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/ssy8vv/guide_bind_vpn_network_interface_to_torrent/) to your torrent client!

- Use a good torrent client, MediaSavvy recommends [qBittorent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). [Here](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Torrenting.html#torrent-clients) are some other options. Avoid the torrent clients listed on the [unsafe programs and websites list.](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/UnsafeSites).

- Scan downloaded files with [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com) for malware. Note: if an antivirus detects anything along the lines of hack tool, patcher, crack or anything similar it's most likely a false positive. Make sure you view the detections of good antiviruses (Bitdefender, Microsoft, Maalwarebytes, Kaspersky etc), not ones you have never heard of before, to minimize false positives.

- Make sure that you have an [adblocker](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Adblocking.html) and [a redirect extension](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Adblocking.html#redirect-bypassers) to bypass annoying waiting times.

- Only use trusted websites from this wiki.

- If you are streaming and it's buffering, you can try [FastStream](https://FastStream.online). FastStream downloads video fragments in parallel. Up to 6x faster download speeds for videos, ensuring smooth playback with no interruptions. 

## 🗣️ Frequently Asked Questions about piracy:

::: details How do I tell if a site or download is safe? 
1. When torrenting, make sure you use a good VPN, [go here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy/#wiki_.25BA_vpn) for good VPN recommendations. I also recommend you using the qBittorent torrent client. Note: Make sure you bind your VPN to your torrent client. [Go here](https://rentry.org/bootyguard#3-configure-your-torrent-client) for a guide on how to do that with qBittorent.

2. Use ad blockers! Many websites you visit to pirate stuff has malicious, scam and intrusive ads. [Go here](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Adblocking.html#adblockers-for-your-browser) for my guide on how to install the best ad blocker on your browser.

3. Only download from trusted sources to avoid getting malware. [Go here](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/) to check out my wiki, which only lists the best and safest options.

4. Scan files you download online using something like [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com) to scan files and folders to ensure that you aren't gonna open malware. Virustotal is a tool that is used by many people (especially pirates) to make sure that their downloaded content is safe. However I recommend instead of downloading the software on your device and scanning it like that, you should instead use VTonColab to scan files before downloading them, which is much safer. Follow [this guide](https://rentry.co/vtoncolab) to show you how you can do that. Note: Make sure that when you are using VTonCOlab that you use dummy accounts for your privacy and safety.

5. Finally, use your common sense.

You can download pre-cracked Adobe products from [M0nkrus](https://vk.com/monkrus) (make sure to use a VPN when downloading from M0nkrus since they are torrents! Also make sure that you DO NOT download collections as they have been accused of having malware on multiple occasions, stick to individual packages) or crack them yourself using GenP [here](https://rentry.co/mediasavvy-genp) (no need for a VPN).

::: details What antivirus should I use?
You really don't need anything other than Windows Defender and an occasional Malwarebytes scan, having other antiviruses is unnecessary and bloatware.
:::

::: details How can I download images from ___ stock site for free?
You can use https://downloader.la or https://getpaidstock.com.

::: details What are the differences between direct downloads and torrents?
Direct downloads are files or streams directly downloaded or streamed from a specific server, and often uses encryption to hide what you are downloading or doing on the website. Direct downloads do not need any VPN. Torrents are files or streams that are downloaded or streamed from someone else's device using the P2P protocol. This method NEEDS a VPN.
:::

::: details Which sites are safe to use/download from?
All websites/programs listed on MediaSavvy (See the different categories on the side bar) is safe to use and the best of the best. However we recommend that you still be cautious and scan files with [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com) as sites that were previously safe may become malicious.  We try our best to prevent this though.
