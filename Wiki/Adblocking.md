::: warning Note:
- For Adguard to block ads better you need to edit some of the setting. To do this go to `Settings > Filtering > Filters` and enable all of the Ad filters, the first 6 privacy filters, all of the annoyance filters and if you want enable some language-specific filters. 
- Don't enable HTTPS filtering, it stops some sites from loading.

### Browser Adblocking

:::warning Note:
Only install one adblocker, using multiple adblockers can reduce their effectiveness and trigger anti-adblock. Using extensions like Sponsorblock is still fine.
:::


:::danger Chrome is disabling adblockers.
Once Google introduces Manifiest V3, adblockers like uBlock Origin and many other extensions will be disabled and won't work anymore. Once this happens it's best to switch to Firefox or a Firefox based browser. If you still want to stay on Chrome you can switch to [uBlock Origin Lite](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home) which is mv3 compatible, but very ineffective.
