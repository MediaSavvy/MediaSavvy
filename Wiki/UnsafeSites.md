::: details Other
- Any websites pretending to be RARBG. This site has been shut down and other malicious alternatives, linked to TPB (The Pirate Bay) have been popping up. Do not trust them.

- Any website you find on Google by searching for "free game downloads", "cracked games" etc. Google removes piracy websites from its search results, which means that fake and malware-spreading sites will float to the top of the search results. This also applies to searches on YouTube as well.

- Any website with a scene group name in their URL are UNSAFE - SCENE GROUPS DON'T HAVE SITES! (Examples such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA etc. They do not have websites. Websites with a combination of these names aren't safe either.

- Torrent aggregators pull results from multiple sites, so it's recommended to avoid using them for software and games.
